Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set


Abstract: This is a data set of Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure. The data set is taken from CASP 5-9. There are 45730 decoys and size varying from 0 to 21 armstrong.

RMSD-Size of the residue. 
F1 - Total surface area. 
F2 - Non polar exposed area. 
F3 - Fractional area of exposed non polar residue. 
F4 - Fractional area of exposed non polar part of residue. 
F5 - Molecular mass weighted exposed area. 
F6 - Average deviation from standard exposed area of residue. 
F7 - Euclidian distance. 
F8 - Secondary structure penalty. 
F9 - Spacial Distribution constraints (N,K Value).
